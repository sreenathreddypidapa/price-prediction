# Mobile Price Prediction

The **Mobile Price Range Prediction** Project aims to classify mobile phones into different price ranges based on their specifications. This involves building a machine learning pipeline to preprocess the data, extract meaningful insights, and train predictive models. The models are evaluated using metrics like F1-Score, and the final model is deployed as an API for real-time prediction.
