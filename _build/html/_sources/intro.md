# About the Book

Welcome to my **Mobile Price Range Prediction** Book! This portfolio offers an in-depth look at my journey, highlighting my academic achievements, technical skills, and the projects Iâ€™ve undertaken. It features a detailed exploration of various machine learning models, including an insightful analysis of the Titanic dataset, demonstrating my expertise in data science and machine learning techniques.


# Project Overview
 
The **Mobile Price Range Prediction** Project aims to classify mobile phones into different price ranges based on their specifications. This involves building a machine learning pipeline to preprocess the data, extract meaningful insights, and train predictive models. The models are evaluated using metrics like F1-Score, and the final model is deployed as an API for real-time prediction.
